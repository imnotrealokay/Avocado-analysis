# Avocado-analysis

## Overview
his project focuses on analyzing employee attendance data from April to June 2022, with the aim of deriving insightful trends and patterns. Utilizing PowerBI for dynamic visualizations, our analysis is fed by a Google Sheets database that updates automatically, ensuring real-time data reflection. Key insights we aim to extract include:

- Employee preferences for working locations (home vs. office).
- Analysis of patterns in days taken off and potential underlying reasons.
- Optimization of team-building activities based on attendance trends throughout the week.
- Monitoring of sick leave trends to identify potential health outbreaks, like seasonal flu or COVID-19, for proactive response.

## Data Source
The data was sourced from the Hass Avocado Board's official website: [Hass Avocado Board](https://hassavocadoboard.com/category-data/). It includes detailed information on avocado prices and sales volumes across various regions and sizes for the years 2015 and updated regularly

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data cleaning and preparation phase is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our analysis. Steps taken in this phase include:

- Data Importation: Securely importing data from Google Sheets into PowerBI.
- Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Data Transformation: Structuring the data in a format suitable for analysis, including categorizing data points like location preference (home/office), types of leave, and timestamps.
- Data Validation: Ensuring the integrity and validity of the data post-cleaning and transformation.

## Analysis Approach

Our approach to analysis is methodical and data-driven, focusing on both quantitative and qualitative aspects:

- Descriptive Analytics: Utilizing PowerBI to create visualizations that depict attendance patterns, location preferences, and leave types.
- Trend Analysis: Identifying specific days or periods with high absence rates and correlating them with external factors (e.g., local events, weather conditions).
- Predictive Insights: Employing statistical methods to predict future trends in employee attendance and potential health outbreaks.
- Decision Support: Providing actionable insights for HR and management, such as optimal times for team-building activities and preemptive health measures during flu season.
  
Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of employee attendance patterns to enhance workplace management and employee well-being.




- What do people prefer, working from home or working from the office?
- If the employees are taking a specific day off then what could be the reason behind that?
- If we have the insights of employees working from home towards the start/end/middle of the week then all team building activities can be planned during that period when most of the people are here.
- If more employees are taking sick leaves then we can assume that there could be seasonal flu or covid outbreaks and we can take extra precautions.
