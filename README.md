# Avocado-analysis
-Due to the rise of vegetarianism, I was wondering if the price of the avocado, depending on the varieties increased over time and if it has an impact on the total volume sold as well as the volume sold for three different PLU codes: 
##PLU4046: Hass small
##PLU4225: Hass large
##PLU4770: Hass extra large
I first imported, renamed some columns, inferred the schema and checked it out
