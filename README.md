# Avocado-analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of rising vegetarianism on avocado prices and consumption patterns from 2015 to 2021. It focuses on three main questions:
1. Does the price influence the volume of avocados sold?
2. Which areas consumed the most avocados during this period?
3. Does the size of the avocado (PLU4770 - Hass extra large) affect its consumption?

## Data Source
The data was sourced from the Hass Avocado Board's official website: [Hass Avocado Board](https://hassavocadoboard.com/category-data/). It includes detailed information on avocado prices and sales volumes across various regions and sizes for the years 2015 and updated regularly

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Combined data from multiple yearly datasets into a single sheet.
- Renamed and restructured columns for better clarity and analysis.
- Cleaned and standardized region data to resolve duplicates (e.g., 'BaltimoreWashington' to 'Baltimore/Washington').
- Focused on key metrics: date, average price, total volume, and volume per PLU codes.
- Excluded general areas (e.g., 'TotalUS', 'West') for more precise regional analysis.

## Analysis Approach
- Investigated the relationship between avocado prices and sales volumes.
- Analyzed regional consumption patterns to identify top avocado-consuming areas.
- Compared sales volumes across different avocado sizes, particularly focusing on the Hass extra large variety (PLU4770).

## Results and Findings
